Regression Analysis for Stock Prediction

# Objective

To perform stock price prediction using Linear Regression and LSTM models.

# Detailed Procedure

Data Collection: Gather historical stock price data from reliable sources.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.

Scale the data for better model performance.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Linear Regression Implementation: Develop a regression model to predict future stock prices.

LSTM Model Development: Design and train an LSTM model for time-series stock price prediction.

Model Evaluation: Compare the accuracy and performance of Linear Regression and LSTM models.

Flask Backend: Implement a Flask-based API to serve model predictions.

Frontend Development: Create a user-friendly interface to visualize stock predictions using charts and graphs.
